description: A recap of how the Scala Community participated in the recent 2023 Advent of Code challenge
---

Happy New Year everyone! Following on from [last year's post][recap-2022], let's see how the Scala community participated in the Advent of Code 2023.

> *[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), started by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), is a yearly event providing daily programming puzzles between December 1st and December 25th.*

Read on to see the breakdown, but a great result is seeing even more engagement in both the [Scala Discord][discord] and on [our solutions website][sc-advent-of-code] than the previous year!

## Why We Do This

At the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch), we love writing code in Scala, we hope you do too. One of our core priorities is to _communicate excitement about Scala_, which motivates us to participate in the Advent of Code and share your experiences solving puzzles with Scala to the wider programming community.

Another key priority is to improve the _onboarding experience for newcomers_. Part of that experience comes from the first impressions someone has reading Scala code. We hope that through hosting articles on [our solutions website][sc-advent-of-code], newcomers can see that programming in Scala is an elegant way to solve problems. As a follow up, we aim to make this website more visible, or at least a selection from it, as a showcase for newcomers ("Scala by example"). You can [help us](#a-call-to-action) complete more of the solutions.

## Engagement from the Community

### Discord Channel

This year, we had over 40 people in the `#advent-of-code` channel on the [Scala Discord server][discord]! Thank you to everyone who shared their code and/or helped each other come up with the best solutions!

### Community Solutions

We also had many more submitted solutions (237!) to [our website][sc-advent-of-code] than the last year (164 submissions), with a lot of first time contributors.
Check out this comparison by day!

We can give a special shout-out to [Rui Alves](https://github.com/xRuiAlves/) who for the second year running has submitted a solution for each day.

### Explainer Articles

Like usual, we reached out to the community to help write the daily articles that explain how to solve the puzzle (e.g. [day 6][aoc-day-06] by `@spamegg1`, or [day 20][aoc-day-20] by `@merlinorg`). This year the community organised a posting schedule, and we were much more successful in getting them written! (more than 2x the previous year) - Thank you to all [the authors](#posting-schedule) who contributed!

<!-- TODO: perhaps we should update the last year blog to include the days with only code -and no article -->

### Visitors

For fun here is a chart of the daily visits to the solutions website, thank you again to [This Week in Scala][thisweekinscala-aoc-dec-11-2023] and [Scala Times][scala-times-aoc-507] for sharing and helping boost visits!

## A Call to Action

Please help us to complete the archive of solutions to Advent of Code. On any day such as [day 21][aoc-day-21] you can click "edit this page" at the bottom, and write an article to explain how to solve the days puzzle. Be sure to observe the [style guide][style-guide].

## Summary

If you read this far, thank you again everyone for contributing to Scala and participating in Advent of Code, we hope you all had fun!

Happy coding!
