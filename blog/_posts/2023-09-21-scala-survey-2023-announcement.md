## The Scala Team wants to hear from you again!

Over the last year we used your feedback from the Scala Survey and to improve the language we all love. This year we want to hear from you again. How has your usage of Scala changed over the last year? Which direction would you like for Scala to take? Take part in the Scala Survey 2023 and shape the future of Scala.

[Scala Survey 2023](https://scala-survey-2023.virtuslab.com/)

The Survey will close on **14.10.2023**.

## About the survey

Completing the survey should take 4-12 minutes, and is anonymous.

Your responses will help us understand Scala’s strengths and weaknesses. They will also be a major factor in determining the development priorities for the Scala team.

We are interested in learning what libraries and tools people are using, what platforms they support, what are the painpoints in their everyday Scala usage, where people are learning to use scala/training engineers, etc.


**Who is the survey intended for?** Everyone. Whether you’re an experienced Scala Developer or just starting your Scala journey, we count on your participation.

After the survey closes, we will publish the aggregated results on the [Scala blog](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/).


## What else can I do to help?

Spread the word! Help us get answers from as many diverse groups as possible. So share the survey on social media, in your office, at your university, at meetups, and in other communities.
