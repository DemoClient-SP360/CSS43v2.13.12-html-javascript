# Contribution Equals Impact: A Spotlight on Goldman Sachs - A Leader in Open Source Contributions

The [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) supports a responsible and sustainable open source ecosystem.
We believe that every meaningful contribution, no matter how small, can have an impact and foster positive relationships within the Scala community, benefiting the ecosystem's longevity.
As part of this mission, the Scala Center is excited to share success stories of organizations that have successfully implemented open source contribution processes.
We do this through the interview series "[Impact of Contribution in the Scala Ecosystem](https://scala-lang.org/blog-detail/2023/03/02/sustainability.html)".
The series aims to create a set of best practice guidelines to facilitate more organizations to engage and contribute, streamlining the process for the whole community and positioning Scala as a standard-bearer for sustainability and responsibility.

In the inaugural piece of this series, we spotlight [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), a leading global financial institution.
Founded in 1869 and headquartered in New York City with offices in all major financial centers around the world, Goldman Sachs delivers a broad range of financial services to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals.

Between 2016 and 2022, Goldman Sachs played an important role as an advisory board member of the Scala Center, significantly contributing to the Scala community's evolution.
We had the privilege of engaging with [Kay XiongPachay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-xiongpachay/), one of the Program Managers of Goldman Sachs' Open Source Program Office (OSPO), in a comprehensive interview.

Kay shares valuable insights on how to effectively establish a successful OSPO and define its objectives, highlighting the strategic benefits a well-structured OSPO can bring to an organization's open-source efforts.

Before joining Goldman Sachs in early 2022, Kay transitioned from retail management to tech.
With this unique journey, Kay brings a user-centric perspective to the open source community, emphasizing empowering engineers, integrating fresh initiatives, and fostering an inclusive culture.
Kay's efforts have been pivotal in fostering an open-source culture at Goldman Sachs.

## Goldman Sachs, Scala Center and the Open Source Landscape

Goldman Sachs exemplifies a significant aspect of their open-source strategy by actively supporting organizations like the Scala Center.
As highlighted earlier, the firm served as a member of the Scala Center advisory board from 2016 to 2022, providing substantial support to further the Scala language and its ecosystem.
However, it is worth noting that Goldman Sachs embarked on its open-source journey well before this partnership, establishing a strong foundation of engagement and contributions in the open-source community.

Goldman Sachs has been contributing to open source for more than 10 years and their Open Source Program Office (OSPO) was launched in 2021, with a vision to consolidate open source, cloud, and software into a unified offering, and formalize its engagement and support for open-source projects.

Prior to this, Goldman Sachs had been an active participant in the open-source community by contributing to and using open-source projects.
They made contributions to projects such as [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), an open-source distributed database management system, and the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric), a blockchain framework, with a focus on helping to improve the functionality, security, and scalability of these projects.

Goldman Sachs has also utilized open-source software across its technology infrastructure.
Open-source technologies provide cost-effective and innovative solutions while enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Recognizing the importance of open source and its impact on the financial industry, Goldman Sachs decided to establish the OSPO to enhance its involvement in open-source initiatives.

The OSPO's primary focus is to facilitate the company's open-source engagements, including contributing to projects, collaborating with external developers, and promoting open-source best practices within Goldman Sachs.
The office also works to ensure compliance with open-source licenses and provides guidance to developers within the company on utilizing open-source software securely and effectively.
The ambitions of the OSPO can be summarized as follows:

* Amplifying the Goldman Sachs open source code contributions by enhancing internal policies, processes, and tools.
* Advocating for the usage of and contribution to projects open-sourced by Goldman Sachs.
* Augmenting Goldman Sachs' role in open source, including active participation in external communities, to support broader objectives in attracting and retaining developers.
* Constantly reviewing and refining Goldman Sachs open source license policies related to code and package consumption.

## Open Source Ecosystem Contributions: Success Stories from Goldman Sachs

Within its inaugural year, the OSPO at Goldman Sachs established an exemplary track record, earning the esteemed title of "OSPO of the Year" at the Linux Foundation's Open Source Summit in June 2022.
They have highlighted their open source projects and contributions on their developer website, with notable open-sourced projects such as [Legend](https://www.finos.org/legend) and [GS Quant](https://developer.gs.com/docs/gsquant/).

Highlighting one of their contributions, Goldman Sachs originally developed GS Collections, a Java collections framework.
This project later evolved into [Eclipse Collections](https://eclipse.dev/collections/) under the aegis of the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/), with the existing feature set of [GS Collections 7.0](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections) remaining intact.
Although primarily Java-based, Eclipse Collections integrates smoothly with Scala, also demonstrating the effective interoperability between Java and Scala.

Goldman Sachs has also defined a broad set of initiatives focused on developers, both internal and external, supporting the continued focus on developing scalable, innovative, and impactful solutions for the firm and its clients.

Moving forward, Goldman Sachs is determined to maintain this momentum.

It is important to acknowledge that Goldman Sachs, being a global organization with offices worldwide, extends its open source contributions beyond Scala to a diverse array of projects across multiple languages and frameworks.
